Hi stranger! Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm Bhishmaraj (pronounced bee-shh-ma). I am currently a software engineer at Google, Hyderabad. Before this I spent a couple of years pursuing theoretical CS from CMI (Chennai Mathematics Institute) and even before that I was a CS undergrad at Shiv Nadar University.
